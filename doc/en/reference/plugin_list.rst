Pytest Plugin List
==================

Below is an automated compilation of ``pytest``` plugins available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_.
It includes PyPI projects whose names begin with ``pytest-`` or ``pytest_`` and a handful of manually selected projects.
Packages classified as inactive are excluded.

For detailed insights into how this list is generated,
please refer to `the update script <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/scripts/update-plugin-list.py>`_.

.. warning::

   Please be aware that this list is not a curated collection of projects
   and does not undergo a systematic review process.
   It serves purely as an informational resource to aid in the discovery of ``pytest`` plugins.

   Do not presume any endorsement from the ``pytest`` project or its developers,
   and always conduct your own quality assessment before incorporating any of these plugins into your own projects.


.. The following conditional uses a different format for this list when
   creating a PDF, because otherwise the table gets far too wide for the
   page.

This list contains 1461 plugins.

   :pypi:`pytest-lock`                              pytest-lock is a pytest plugin that allows you to "lock" the results of unit tests, storing them in a local cache. This is particularly useful for tests that are resource-intensive or don't need to be run every time. When the tests are run subsequently, pytest-lock will compare the current results with the locked results and issue a warning if there are any discrepancies.
